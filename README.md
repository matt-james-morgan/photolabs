# Matt's Photolab
This is my first full stack app, you can load photos from the database and like photos and view a close up version of the photo.

## Features
This will display all photos from a database on first load. If you favourite a photo you will be notified by the heart on the top right. 

If you select a topic, it will only show photos relating to that topic. Your favourites will be remembered though.
